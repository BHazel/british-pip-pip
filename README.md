# British++

British++ (pronounced _British Pip Pip_) is a fun set of header-only modifications built on top of C and C++ to add a bit of good old British flair to code!  _Tally ho!_

## Technologies

* C, C++
* CMake
* Doxygen

## Getting Started

Installation of British++ is simple and managed by CMake!  Please simply create a `build` directory and run all CMake commands from there.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

To include British++ in your code please simply include the main header file and _Bob's your Uncle_!

```cpp
#include <bwhazel/britis.h>
```

A **Quick Start** guide to create a sample programme is included in the documentation, which can be built and accessed using:

```shell
make docs
open ./docs/html/index.html
```

## Disclaimer

**Although I am unashamedly patriotic and a proud British citizen it should go without saying that this is all in the name of fun!  It is not intended to cause offence or discomfort to anyone.**
